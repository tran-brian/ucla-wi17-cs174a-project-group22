--------------

**“Bruinwalk”** is about an undergraduate student’s experience in UCLA, majoring in Computer Science. The main character, Comsy Injuneer, wanders around the campus to match items with corresponding items to graduate. 

Comsy is built based on char modeling with primitive shapes, along with "animation” using scene graph. In the game, user controls the screen by moving the mouse left or right, and click the location where the user wants Comsy to go.

UCLA, composed with Powell, Royce, and Boelter that are rendered from obj file, has particle effects which makes the campus looks dreamlike. When user left-clicks on an item, Comsy fakes picking up the item using bounding boxes and collision detection. Axis Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection is used, and the background music is included for enhanced user experience.
